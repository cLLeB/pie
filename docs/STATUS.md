# PIE — Build Status & Road to 100%

Honest tracking of what's built vs. what "100% / production" requires. Updated 2026-06-30.

## Tests: 92 passing (integrity-core 56 · candidate 13 · review 6 · server 17). TS+Py, all green.

## Done ✅
- [x] **Research & design** — 4-doc dossier (landscape, architecture, sauce, cost) in `docs/research/`.
- [x] **`@pie/integrity-core`** — the Proof-of-Authorship engine (framework-agnostic TS):
  - [x] SHA-256 + canonical serialization
  - [x] Tamper-evident hash-chained ledger (`verifyChain` pinpoints tampering)
  - [x] Provenance: edit-ops model, authorship metrics (pasteRatio), replay
  - [x] Sensor mesh: `Sensor` interface, `SensorMesh`, `VisibilitySensor`, `FullscreenSensor`
  - [x] `ProvenanceRecorder` (InputEvent → ops)
  - [x] `AuthenticityBundle` assembler (carries ops for replay)
  - [x] HMAC certificate signing + `verifyCertificate` + `verifySignedBundle`
- [x] **`@pie/candidate`** — React PWA exam runner: live provenance capture, sensor mesh wired
      (focus/visibility/fullscreen/clipboard), glass-box transparency panel, signed certificate on submit.
- [x] **`@pie/review`** — instructor console: verify signed certificate (chain + root + signature),
      per-answer authorship metrics, **keystroke replay scrubber**, tamper simulation.

- [x] **Candidate ↔ review handoff** — `serializeCertificatePackage`/`parseCertificatePackage`;
      candidate downloads `pie-certificate-*.json`, review console imports + verifies it. Loop closed.

- [x] **Server (`@pie/server`, FastAPI)** — event ingestion, **server-side HMAC signing** (per-tenant
      secret, **byte-identical to the TS signer**, cross-language test pinned), verify endpoint,
      certificate registry. 11 pytest. (Persistence still in-memory → Postgres/object-store next.)

- [x] **Wire candidate → server signing** — injectable `serverThenLocal` signer (server-side signing
      with offline local fallback); CORS configurable; mocked-fetch tests.
- [x] **Identity layer (server)** — `/v1/identity/verify` fronting the biometric `/v1` (injectable
      `IdentityClient`, httpx MockTransport test). Next: candidate continuous-identity loop binding
      identity results into the ledger as events.
- [x] **Exam delivery (server)** — `GET /v1/exams/{id}` + `ExamRepo`. Next: candidate fetches it; QTI import.
- [x] **Deploy scaffold** — server `Dockerfile` + root `docker-compose.yml` (on-prem, offline).
- [ ] **On-device vision sensors** — `FacePresenceSensor` core done; wire MediaPipe/ONNX in the app
      (face presence/count, gaze/head-pose, phone/object). Privacy-first (events, not footage).
- [ ] **Persistence** — Postgres + object store behind the `Store` interface (in-memory today).
- [ ] **Timer + exam lifecycle** — countdown, autosave, resume, submit deadlines.
- [ ] **LMS integration** — LTI 1.3 launch + QTI item import + Caliper events.
- [ ] **Browser extension (MV3)** — screen/multi-monitor/process signals for the high-stakes rung.
- [ ] **Deployment** — Docker Compose (on-prem/air-gapped) + cloud; bundle the biometric engine.
- [ ] **Hardening** — security review (extension/helper), bias audit of identity step, accessibility,
      pilot validation that provenance separates authored vs. pasted without false positives.
- [ ] **Research-completeness** — clone + run the OSS reference repos; full-read the key papers;
      business-model + legal/region pass (GDPR/BIPA).

## Definition of "100%"
A self-hostable, LMS-embeddable exam platform where a candidate sits a proctored exam in the browser,
on-device sensors + the biometric engine produce a signed, tamper-evident Authenticity Certificate,
and an instructor verifies and replays it — running free on-prem, with the paid cloud/video tiers
optional. We have the **core loop**; the list above is the remaining surface.
